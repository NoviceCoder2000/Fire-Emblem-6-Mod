# Fire-Emblem-Civ
An UnCiv mod that brings Nintendo's Fire Emblem into the game, by adding custom nations, units and leaders!

# Features:

- Fire Emblem Lords as Nation Leaders
- Civilizations based on the lore of Fire Emblem such as a United Elibe and Magvel!
- Fire Emblem Units: Includes the infamous Dragon Lords from FE6 and the Great Knights from FE8
- Hero Units
- And more!

(Note: This mod is still work and progress and currently features the FE6 Universe in the game.)

# Disclaimer:

I do not own Fire Emblem or its franchise. This mod is based over Nintendo and Intelligent System's game, Fire Emblem 6: The Binding Blade. This mod is absolutely NON-PROFIT and made just for fun.
