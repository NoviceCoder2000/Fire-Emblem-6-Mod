# Fire-Emblem-6-Mod
A unciv mod that hopes to bring Fire Emblem 6 units into the game by adding custom civilizations, units, etc. 

# Features:

- A United Alliance of Lycia: Along with the cities and towns featured in game.
- Fire Emblem 6 Units: Featuring Pegasus Knights, Paladins, Snipers, Wyvern Lords, Etc.
- Roy as a unit!
- And more!

(Disclaimer: I do not own Fire Emblem or its franchise. This mod is based over Nintendo and Intelligent System's game Fire Emblem, and this mod is absolutely NON-PROFIT and made just for fun.)

(Note: For Fire Emblem Fans, this civilization is set after the end of the war against Bern, meaning it occurs after the events of FE6. Everything related to this mod is mainly non-canonical and the author doesn't consider it as canon. Inadvisable to use on tournaments pr serious games.)
